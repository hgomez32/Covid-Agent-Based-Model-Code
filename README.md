# Covid-Agent-Based-Model-Code
This repository contains code that I created to model/predict the outcome of Covid-19 cases under different specified parameters and environments. A link below is attached to view the presentation I gave on this project which explains what agent based modeling is, what are the pros and cons of agent based modeling, the different types of intervention, and the overall process that is taken to yield results with this type of model. For reference an SIR(sick-infected-recovered) model is used to observe the different graphs produced by different levels of intervention(vaccination, quarantining, social distancing, etc.) during the outbreak of Covid-19.
